Project Title: E-Commerce Marketing
Technologies: Data Cleansing, EDA, Visualization, Machine Learning & Deep Learning
Domain: E-Commerce



Problem Statement:

In the ever-evolving landscape of e-commerce, companies face the challenge of optimizing their marketing strategies to achieve maximum impact. Imagine you are part of a marketing team tasked with optimizing the budget for an e-commerce firm based in Ontario, Canada. The company specializes in electronic products and has invested significantly in marketing over the past year, including big-ticket promotions. The CFO believes that the return on investment from the marketing spend has not been sufficiently impactful. The challenge is to either streamline the marketing budget or strategically reallocate it across various marketing levers to enhance the revenue response.

Data Understanding

The Dataset covers the period from July 2015 to June 2016 and includes:

1. Order Level Data:
   - FSN ID: Unique SKU identifier
   - Order Date: Date of order placement
   - Order ID: Unique order identification number
   - Order Item ID: Unique order item identifier
   - GMV: Gross Merchandise Value (Revenue)
   - Units: Number of units sold
   - Order Payment Type: Payment method (prepaid or cash on delivery)
   - SLA: Number of days for product delivery
   - Cust ID: Unique customer identifier
   - Product MRP: Maximum retail price
   - Product Procurement SLA: Time taken to procure the product

2. Additional Information:
   - Monthly spend on various advertising channels
   - Days with special sales
   - Monthly Net Promoter Score (NPS) as a proxy for the voice of the customer
   - Stock Index of the company on a monthly basis

Data Preparation

Create ML & DL models for three product subcategories: camera accessory, home audio, and gaming accessory. Develop models at a weekly level for each sub-category.

Feature Engineering

Incorporate climate data for the Ontario region to analyze its potential impact on revenue. Create features, including Pay date (1st or 15th of the month) and holidays, represented by a flag (0 or 1) indicating their presence.

Exploratory Data Analysis

Conduct univariate and bivariate analyses, correlation studies, cross-tabs, and visualizations on the pre-analytical dataset. Obtain insights, shortlist variables for modeling, and create key performance indicators (KPIs). Provide comments explaining the rationale for choosing these KPIs.

Modeling

Build basic, logarithmic, and multiplicative models or any other suitable ML & DL models using the available dataset. Analyze the impact of various attributes on the target variable using appropriate metrics.

Presentation of Results

Select the best models for each product sub-category and present them in a clear, understandable manner. Develop a PowerPoint presentation that explains the chosen models, highlighting the importance of variables in predicting future sales. Point out any surprising or unexpected trends observed during the analysis.

Note: 
After completion of all the task you need to create a PowerPoint presentation that should contain the: 
1. Problem Statement
2. Tools Used
3. Approaches
4. EDA Insights
5. Conclusion/Suggestion
